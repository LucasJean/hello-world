# hello-world
It gives the world hello.
It is where it begins
But no end is at view, it seems
And as the violent waters drag us all
'Till we no longer have a picture of the shore
Our bodies and minds slowly fade into the mist
Until one day we rise from the abyss anew

The mobs of the earth vibrate exhilarated
as they spread the word that Death was thwarted
And so the world may again shift it's gears
Towards the future in blistering hope
Humanity rides Ixion's wheel again
As we're left gazing at mirrors
Screaming the silent agony of flesh and blood
Beholding a room laden with phantoms
